"But I must explain to 
you how all this 
mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice was b
orn and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual 
teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislik
es, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue plea
sure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pur
sues or desires to obtain nice of itself, because it is nice, but because occasionally circumstances occur in w
hich toil and nice can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertak
es laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a ple
asure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a nice that produces no resultant pleasure?"
